if you havent used git since august set up your personal access token in settings>developer settings and use it 
instead of your password when git prompts for your username and password

"You can store your credentials using the following command

$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>"
